# In ${MYSIGILREPO}/build/bin you will find the newly built Sigil.app

# To test if the newly bundled python 3 version of Sigil is working properly ypou can do the following:

1. download testplugin_v014.zip from https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/tree/master/docs
2. open Sigil.app to the normal nearly blank template epub it generates when opened
3. use Plugins->Manage Plugins menu and make sure the "Use Bundled Python" checkbox is checked
4. use the "Add Plugin" button to navigate to and add testplugin.zip and then hit "Okay" to exit the Manage Plugins Dialog
5. use Plugins->Edit->testplugins to launch the plugin and hit the "Start" button to run it
6. check the plugin output window for your missing or broken plugin test results
